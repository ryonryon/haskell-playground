## My Haskell Playground

Welcome to my Haskell Playground! This project is designed to help me understand Haskell syntaxes, characteristics, and functional programming.

### Goals

The main goals of this project are:

- To deepen my understanding of Haskell syntaxes
- To explore and experiment with different Haskell characteristics
- To improve my skills in functional programming with Haskell

### How to run

runghc is a Haskell compiler that can be used to run Haskell programs. To run a Haskell program, use the following command:

```shell
runghc Hello.hs
```

Alternatively, you can use the ghc command to compile your code into an executable file, and then run the executable. Here's how to do it:

```shell
ghc -o Hello Hello.hs
./Hello
```

### How to build

To build your Haskell code, you can use the ghc command followed by the name of your Haskell file. For example, if you have a file called Hello.hs, you can build it using the following command:

```shell
ghc Hello.hs
```

This will generate an executable file called Hello. You can then run the executable using the following command:

```shell
./Hello
```

### How to run in console

```shell
ghci
```

also you can leave GHCi by

```shell
:q
```
